## üöÄ Getting started

1.  **Clone the repository**

    git clone https://github.com/GSTJ/Thesys
    cd thesys/server
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary packages.**

    ```sh

    const whitelist = ['https://www.(YOURDOMAIN).com']
    ```

4)  **Start developing.**

    Initiate the project in development mode

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Building

Once you're done developing, you can simply start it on your production server

```sh
yarn start
```
