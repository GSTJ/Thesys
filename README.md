# :postbox: FAQ

### 🙋‍ What is Thesys?

Thesys is a digital platform for sharing legal knowledge. I built it for the GLH (Global Legal Hackathon) semi-finals.

Realizing the time it takes to find a legal thesis on our country (Brazil), we started building a tool to help people find the right legal thesis, without going through a lot of trial and error.

The platform is not only for legal research and education but also for professional development.

For those who are interested in getting more information on this project: https://www.thesys.com.br/.

#### 👨‍💻 Server
