## 🙋‍ What is Thesys?

Thesys is a digital platform for sharing legal knowledge. It was buit for the GLH (Global Legal Hackathon) semi-finals.

Realizing the time it takes to find a legal thesis on our country (Brazil), and how little we used one after writing it, we decided to give lawyers the ability to reach those looking for thesis and provide it, either free (for recognition) or paid through our platform.

The platform in itself isn't ready yet, so I built this landing page to capture leads and start testing our idea!
